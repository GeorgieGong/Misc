Misc

I intend to collect small things that I find myself doing over and over again
and automate those things and publish the results here. Most of the 
small scripts and templates are quite KAUST specific. Any feedback
and contributions from the KAUST community are appreciated.

As of now the repository offers:
-Plotting routines in python in KAUST colors
-A "KAUST Compliant" Beamer template
-A template for the SRI UQ Center in KAUST, hopefully usable
for other KAUST researchers and students beyond the UQ Center.

Any additions that might be of use to KAUST users are welcomed.
The preferred method of additions/improvements is through a pull request,
but if the learning curve for git is too steep for you, you can contact
the initiator at juho.happola@iki.fi

As far as the copyrights are concerned, this is a compilation
of multiple items that are distributed under different terms.
